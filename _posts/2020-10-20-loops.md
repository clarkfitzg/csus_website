- Write functions with `for` and `while` loops
- Know when to write loops, and when to use vectorized functions or `lapply` and related functions

## `for` loops

`for` loops are used to iterate through vectors, for example:

```{r}
for(i in 1:5){
    print(i^2)
}
```

The general form is:

```{r}
for(VAR in SEQ){
    RUN THIS BLOCK OF CODE
}
```

It's approximately equivalent to:

```{r}
VAR = SEQ[[1]]
RUN CODE

VAR = SEQ[[2]]
RUN CODE

...

VAR = SEQ[[length(SEQ)]]
RUN CODE
```


## Alternatives to `for` loops


Suppose we want to compute the result of `log` applied to several elements in a vector.
We can always do it in a `for` loop:

```{r}
x = 1:5
ans = rep(NA, length(x))
for(i in seq_along(x)){
    ans[i] = log(x[i])
}
```

`log` is vectorized.
Instead of explicitly looping, we can just do:

```{r}
log(x)
```

That is, vectorized functions implicitly loop over their elements, and apply functions elementwise.
You could even take this as the definition of a vectorized function.

If a vectorized function is not available, then we can still loop through `lapply` and `sapply`.
The `s` in `sapply` is for "simplify" to a vector.

```{r}
sapply(x, log)
```


## When to use loops

Use explicit loops when there is true loop carried data dependence.
This means that what we do in one iteration of the loop affects what we do in a later iteration.
`lapply` and friends cannot handle this case.

A classic example is calculating the Fibonacci sequence.

```{r}
n = 10
a = 0
b = 1
for(i in seq(n)){
    apb = a + b
    a = b
    b = apb
}
```

Here `a` and `b` represent the two most recently calculated numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
With every iteration we compute the next number, `apb`, by adding `a` and `b`, and then set `a` and `b` to the most recently calculated numbers.
