Data scientists must communicate their results to make an impact.
One way to communicate is through written reports.
The components of the rubric follow, as well as a description of how you can earn full points.


## Writing

- Write clearly and directly.
- Use correct grammar and spelling.
- Cite external sources appropriately.
    Hyperlinks are perfect.
    Write descriptive link titles, for example, "according to the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/) ...".


## Focus

- Address the questions in the assignment prompt.
- Tailor your report to the audience.
- Limit unnecessary detail and jargon.


## Plots

- Use plots and figures to support your claims.
- Reference the plot in the body of the text immediately above or below.
- Follow plotting principles covered in class. (TODO: link to lecture)
