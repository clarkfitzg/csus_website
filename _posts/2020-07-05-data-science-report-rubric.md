Data scientists must communicate their results to make an impact.
One way to communicate is through written reports.
The components of the rubric follow, as well as a description of how you can earn full points.
The point values for each of these components are listed on the assignment page, and may differ among assignments.

_TODO: link these to relevant lectures_

## Content

- Use appropriate computational and statistical techniques when analyzing the data.
- Make correct conclusions, supported by the data.


## Programming

- Choose clear, meaningful variable names, for example, `annual_income_dollars` rather than `i`.
- Comment to explain code blocks that may be unclear.
- Organize code in short, reusable functions.
    Don't repeat yourself by repeating the same line of code many times with only minor variations.
- Avoid complexity where possible.
    Examples include long lines, deep nesting, and complex control flow.


## Plots

- Use plots and figures to support your claims.
- Reference the plot in the body of the text immediately above or below.
- Follow plotting principles covered in class.


## Focus

- Address the questions in the assignment prompt.
- Tailor your report to the audience.
- Limit unnecessary detail and jargon.


## Writing

- Write clearly and directly.
- Use correct grammar and spelling.
- Cite external sources appropriately.
    Hyperlinks are perfect.
    Write descriptive link titles, for example, "according to the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/) ...".
