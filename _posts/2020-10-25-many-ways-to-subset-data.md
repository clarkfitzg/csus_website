[live notes](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/stat128/blob/master/2020-10-26.Rmd)

Announcements:

Midterm in two parts.
In class part of midterm through Canvas quizzes on Friday, October 30th.
Multiple choice / true false, etc.
Take home part of midterm due Sunday, November 1st.
Let me know ASAP if you have technical / internet / scheduling issues.
Watch the review videos, the questions will be on those concepts.


Plan today:

- Review mid quarter check in.
- Showcase some of the unique plots from Q3 in the Roulette homework.
- Group activity to review all the ways to subset a data frame.

Goal today is to step back and review / compare and contrast all the ways we know to select subsets of a data frame.

## Group activity

Come up with all the ways you know how to select subsets of a vector or data frame.
We'll do examples with the `mtcars` data set, because cars are on my mind right now. üòÅ
