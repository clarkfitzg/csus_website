Asking questions during live class is the fastest and most efficient way to communicate.
Outside of class, the best way to communicate is through Discord and Canvas.
For private matters, you can come to office hours or email me at <fitzgerald@csus.edu>.

## In Class

Please ask questions during class.
Questions help clarify the material for other students, and they show me where I need to improve my explanation.

Ask your question via Zoom chat whenever it comes up for you during the course of the class meeting.
There's no need to wait for me to pause and ask for questions.
Don't worry about interrupting.
I monitor the chat, and when I see a question come through I will find a natural place to stop and address it.

Occasionally, I might defer a question to office hours.
During office hours, we can also meet privately through Zoom breakout rooms, so just ask if you would like to speak privately.
You can even send a private message to me through Zoom chat.


## Outside Class

### Canvas

We will use Canvas announcements for time sensitive, important announcements that everyone in class should see.
For example, when I post the final exam I will send a Canvas announcement.
Set your [Canvas notification preferences](https://csus.instructure.com/profile/communication) to email or give you a push notification for Announcements.
You can also set your notifications specific to each course by navigating to the home page of the course and clicking on the button with a bell labeled "View Course Notifications".

If you are going to be late on an assignment, then turn in what you have, and leave a comment in the assignment submission form on Canvas telling me what's going on and when you expect to finish.
Later, when I grade the assignment, that comment will show up and I will have some context for why that assignment is missing.

### Discord

For questions and discussions on course content and policies, please use [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/@me).
The best thing about Discord is that everyone in class can benefit from the discussion, and other students can respond and help you as well.
This is not possible with email, which is why I check and respond to public questions on Discord much more frequently than email.

If you have a question that requires my input, then tag me with `@Dr. Fitz` to make sure that I pay attention to it.
Do not worry about bothering me at any time of the day or night, because I set my notifications so that I am notified if and only if I want to be notified.
You should do the same.
If I unplug for a long bike ride or a camping trip, then I'll see the notifications the next time I sign on, no problem.

I've set up our Discord with a handful of channels.
Feel free to [mute any of them](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/209791877-How-do-I-mute-and-disable-notifications-for-specific-channels-).

- __# general__ for general questions on content, class policies, etc.
- __# lost__ when you are lost, or you have no idea what is going on, and you need help.
    No question is too basic here, and nobody will judge you for asking any legitimate question.
- __# off-topic__ when you want to share something with the class, but it's not related to the class.
    For example, finding buddies to play video games with, or [Mandalorian memes](https://gamerant.com/star-wars-mandalorian-best-memes/)


### Email

If you need to communicate with me privately, then you can use private messages in Discord, or you can email me at <fitzgerald@csus.edu>.
I'll typically see and respond to the private messages in Discord sooner, because I check that more often than email.
However, if it's an official form or something that I need to forward to other people at the University, then email is better than Discord.


### General Advice

It's easy to be misunderstood in an online environment.
Here's a good general rule of thumb for online:

> If you wouldn't say it in front of your Grandmother, then don't say it in class.

Think before you post, and listen to your better judgement.
Don't post anything online that you might regret or be embarrassed about later.
This advice holds for your personal, academic, and professional lives.
If you're not in the right frame of mind, then sleep on it, and decide what you really want to say, or if you want to say anything at all.
