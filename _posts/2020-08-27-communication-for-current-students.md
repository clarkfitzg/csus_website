Communication with current students is my top priority, and this post demonstrates how to communicate efficiently in my courses.
The fastest way to communicate publicly with me and all other students in a course is through Canvas discussions.
Assignment submission comments are optional; they provide direct, asynchronous, private, communication with me, your instructor.

When you post a new reply within a discussion, the first words should summarize your question or comment.
Putting the topic first allows the reader to quickly determine the content of the thread without expanding it.
For example, which is the better thread summary?

1. "How do I convert a factor to an integer? I've tried ..."
2. "Dear Professor Fitzgerald, I was recently reading about ..."

Salutations, for example, "Dear Professor Fitzgerald," are fine in more formal emails, but are not helpful in discussion threads.
If you want someone's attention, then you should actually tag them using @name, like all the social media sites use.
Canvas doesn't have this capability at the time of this writing, so it doesn't matter.

Keep these conventions in mind when you set your [Canvas notification preferences](https://csus.instructure.com/profile/communication).
You should always receive immediate notifications about course announcements and discussion threads that you are following.
Other professors will likely have other preferences.
You can also set your notifications specific to each course by navigating to the home page of the course and clicking on the button with a bell labeled "View Course Notifications".

Think before you post, and listen to your better judgement.
Don't post anything online that you might regret or be embarrassed about later.
This advice holds for your personal, academic, and professional lives.
If you're not in the right frame of mind, then sleep on it, and decide what you really want to say, or if you want to say anything at all.
