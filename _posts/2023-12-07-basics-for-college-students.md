This advice is for any student taking conventional, in person, college classes.
If you follow this advice, then you will be well on your way to success.

The next steps are (TODO: write post)



#### Have a Goal

You need to care about your education and be motivated.
People have all kinds of different motivations, for example:

1. Earn a degree in nursing so they can get a lucrative job as an registered nurse.
2. Pass calculus with a C or better.
3. Make their families proud.
4. Escape a job or career that they don't like.
5. Challenge their intellect and push themselves farther than they've gone before.

A goal that keeps you personally invested in your education is a good thing.
A goal that places so much stress and pressure on you that it makes you physically sick is not a good thing.

If you don't have a goal, then work with people you trust to develop a goal.
When I advise students, usually I ask "what do you want to do after college?".
It's OK if you don't know.
Indeed, I didn't have an answer to that question.
By doing well in school, earning good grades, you have more options such as graduate school.
Options are good.


#### Attend Class

Show up on time to every lecture so you can engage with the material.
This is what you paid for!
It doesn't matter if the material doesn't interest you, or the instructor is difficult to understand, or almost nobody else comes to class.
Keep attending.

Commuting stands out as an especially difficult barrier to attending class.
If your car breaks down, or there's a crash and traffic is at a standstill, then you might be literally stuck.
You may have to think outside of the box to come up with solutions to these issues.
When I first started college, I lived with my grandparents (for free- thanks Grandma and Grandpa!), caught the bus at 6:30 AM for a 1 hour commute to campus, and came home around 6:00 PM, five days a week.
Ideally, you can live close enough to campus to walk, bike, or take a reliable and convenient form of public transportation.

<!--
Commuting and family obligations stand out as especially difficult barriers to attending class.
If your child gets sick and cannot go to daycare or elementary school, then your family obligations will trump your personal commitment to attending class.
Ideally, you have a strong network and support structure that can help out with kids.
Do communicate 
-->

Consider attending school your job, and show up to the job.
The military taught me to always show up and be on time, and this habit stayed with me all through college and graduate school.
In 7 or so years of taking classes, I've missed not more than a handful of lectures, when I was too sick to get out of bed.
My thinking was always: "I paid for college with my blood, sweat and tears, and I *will* get my money's worth!"


#### Pay Attention in Class

Make the most of your attendance.
Sit in a place where you can clearly see the board and hear the instructor.
Take notes in a way that works for you.
Put your phone in "do not disturb" mode and put it some place where you won't notice it vibrating; you can check it when class is done.
Put your headphones away and listen to the class.

You've already taken the time and effort to be physically present.
To benefit from the lecture you must be mentally present as well.


#### Spend Time on Homework and Studying

In a challenging mathematics or statistics class, you must put in the hours doing homework and studying.
You can expect to spend at least 2 to 3 hours outside of class for every hour in class.
It's OK to study as long and as hard as you need to reach the goals you've set for yourself.

If you're putting in the time, then you should have no trouble submitting all your assignments by the time that they are due.
You may make mistakes, and you might not be able to finish everything, but that's to be expected, because you're learning.
Write down your questions, and ask the instructor in class or office hours.

Working long hours prevents many students from spending the necessary time studying.
I see way too many students attempting to work 30+ hours a week while going to school full time.
This is a recipe for disaster.

Think outside the box, and do whatever you can to minimize all time commitments other than school during the semester.


#### Do All Assignments Honestly

Imagine you're in class staring at a problem on your final exam.
If you've been doing all the homeworks on your own or with a small group, struggling through the hard parts, grasping every step, then you did it honestly, and you're probably ready.
If you've been relying on some technology or shady means of completing the homeworks in an extremely short amount of time, with minimal effort on your part, then you didn't you're probably not ready.

It must be incredibly tempting to take shortcuts, because there's so much out there.
