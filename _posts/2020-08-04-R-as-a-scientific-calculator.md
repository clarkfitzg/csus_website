- Why teach obsolete technologies?
- Why make students evaluate something like `pbinom(7, size = 15, prob = 0.4)`?
    Tedious and error prone.
- Some topics are even obsolete.
    For example, an approximation, if the only purpose of the approximation is to get to a known table so you can evaluate something.
- Goal is to use R as a scientific calculator, which is much simpler than learning to program.
- Any interpreted language will work the same here: Python, Julia, R
- R works well for statistics classes because it doesn't require external libraries, and the plotting is especially easy.
- Requires minimal expertise from instructor, a good thing.
- Sets students up for best practices
- The price is right, open source software, open educational resources.
