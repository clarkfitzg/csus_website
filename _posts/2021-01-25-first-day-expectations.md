- Set expectations for this class
- Break the ice with an activity so you talk to each other

## Expectations

This is a brand new experimental course.
We're going to push the boundaries of technology and try new things, and they won't all work.
I'm OK with that.

### The Bad

Here's why you might want to run away now. 👎

1. I like to "learn by doing".
    We're going to get our hands dirty processing large amounts of data.
1. Assignments will be open ended, and my expectations are high.
1. We have very little support.
2. My experience with AWS is limited.

123 GO: What's AWS?

Be careful about unintentionally excluding people by using acronyms.

There are seemingly unlimited resources for learning available online, and we can find them and learn together.
I'm OK with not being the expert at all things.

### The Good

Here's why you might want to stick around. 👍

1. I taught a [similar class at UC Davis](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/sta141c-winter19), and I've spent about 10 years working in this field.
3. I'll communicate often and support you as well as I can by engaging on Discord.
2. We'll build up to the more involved assignments by focusing on individual prerequisite skills.
3. I'll grade fairly, accounting for your background and circumstances.
4. 🤑💵💰🤑💵💰🤑💵💰


## What I expect from you

2. Give assignments an honest effort.
1. Stay calm when things don't work out.
3. Help each other, and me.
3. Communicate with me.

Now you have some idea of what to expect, and you can decide for yourselves if this is the class for you.
Maybe you prefer a more conventional class.
Maybe you would like to take it with me next year, once some of the bugs have been worked out.
Please adjust your schedules accordingly, and I will approve your drops for any reason.


## Quiz Activity

1. Take the day 1 quiz.
    You have 5 minutes to do it by yourself.
    Don't communicate at all.
    The goal is to get a low score now, so you can improve it later.
    After the five minutes are up, we'll come back to class and see how the score distribution looks.
    Remind me to remove the time limit restriction.
2. We're done with Zoom now, but I'll leave the meeting running.
    Join Discord, pick a random group room: "# alligators", "# birds", "# cats", "# dogs", "# elephants"
    Introduce yourselves, work together, explain the right answers, and improve your quiz scores.
    Get my attention if you have a question.
    See you next class!
