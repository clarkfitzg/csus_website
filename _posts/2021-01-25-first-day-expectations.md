- Set expectations for this class
- Break the ice with an activity

## Expectations

This is a brand new experimental course.
We're going to push the boundaries of technology and try new things, and they won't all work.
I'm OK with that.

### The Bad

Here's why you might want to run away now. ðŸ˜±

1. I like to "learn by doing".
    We're going to get our hands dirty processing large amounts of data.
1. Assignments will be open ended, and my expectations are high.
1. We have very little support.
2. My experience with AWS is limited.

123 GO: What's AWS?

Be careful about unintentionally excluding people by using acronyms.

### The Good

Here's why you might want to stick around.

1. I taught a [similar class at UC Davis](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/sta141c-winter19), and I've spent about 10 years working in this field.
2. We'll build up to the harder assignments by focusing on individual prerequisite skills.
3. I'll support you as well as I can by engaging on Discord.
3. I'll grade fairly, accounting for your background and circumstances.
