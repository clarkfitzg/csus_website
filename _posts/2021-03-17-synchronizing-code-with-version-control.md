- describe idea and use cases for version control
- use version control to synchronize files between a laptop and a server

This is an introduction to `git`, assuming no experience with version control.
`git` is another industrial grade software tool, with capabilities far beyond what we'll cover today.
Today we'll see one version of "best practices".


## Announcements

123 GO - what makes you productive when you study?

- Mid quarter check in survey due tomorrow


# A __commit__ in version control saves a snapshot of your codebase. {.t}

123 GO - When is a good time to take a snapshot?



# You can __push__ and __pull__ changes between local and remote machines. {.t}

Three places for code:

- laptop
- EC2 instance
- Git server (Github, bitbucket, ...)


# What are the benefits of version control? {.t}

`hw1v1.pdf`, `hw1v2.pdf`, `hw1v3.pdf`, `hw1final.pdf`, `hw1final2.pdf`, ...

git, svn (subversion)


# Demo

- Uploading SSH keys to Github
- Creating EC2 instance with more disk space
- `ssh -A` to use key forwarding
- Cloning
- Pushing, pulling
- Merging with and without conflicts
