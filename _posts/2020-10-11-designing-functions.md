## `source`

R by itself comes with a bunch of functionality.
A strength of R is the large ecosystem of 3rd party code in packages, for example, ggplot2.
I don't need to write all the code that makes ggplot2 work, I just load it up and I can start using it.

Q: How do we load packages?
A: `library(ggplot2)`, for example

We're going to work with this roulette simulator again.
I already wrote all the code, and it works fine.
I don't want to reimplement all the functions, I just want to use them.
We need something like `library`, but I haven't gone to the (minimal) trouble of creating a package yet.
I want something a little lighter weight- that's `source`.

I'll start a new R terminal and verify that I haven't yet defined any variables.
You can think of `ls` as "list variables".

```{r}
ls()
```

I've made [`roulette.R` publicly available](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarkfitzg/stat128/master/roulette.R).

Q: What is this file?
A: It's an R __script__, a single file containing valid R expressions.
Think of it as simply a big code chunk.
Instead of saving it in an Rmarkdown document with extension `.Rmd`, I've saved it as a plain text file with extension `.R`.

`source` will evaluate all the expressions in the file, just like I had typed them in the console.

Q: Do you think you need to be careful with a function like `source`?
A: Yes, particularly from a URL!
This can run arbitrary code on your computer, which people can use to do bad things.
It's the same as installing unknown software from the internet- you better trust it.
You can trust me. ðŸ˜œ

```{r}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarkfitzg/stat128/master/roulette.R")
```

If I download the file locally then I can pass in the local file path to `source`.

```{r}
source("~/projects/stat128/roulette.R")
```

Now that I've ran all the code in the file, I see the functions that were defined in `roulette.R`.

```{r}
ls()
# [1] "column1"         "doublebet"       "even"            "high"
# [5] "play"            "simple_strategy" "single"
```


## DRY

Q: Has anyone heard the acronym "DRY" in the context of programming?
It means "Do not Repeat Yourself".
`source` is one way to not repeate yourself.
Functions are another way.


## Motivation

For the next homework, we're going deeper into typical outcomes when you gamble by doing many simulations.

```{r}
NTIMES = 1000L
d = play(simple_strategy(even), nplayers = 1000L, ntimes = NTIMES)
```

I would like to know the mean and standard deviation of winnings at every time point `time`.
For the simple strategies, we can evaluate these analytically, and treat these as a function of `time`.
For example, for bets that pay 1:1, like evens, we can do:

```{r}
mean_theory = function(time){
    pwin = 18 / 37
    m1 = -1 * (1 - pwin) + 1 * pwin
    time * m1
}

sd_theory = function(time){
    pwin = 18 / 37
    mx2 = (-1)^2 * (1 - pwin) + 1^2 * pwin
    v1 = mx2 - mean_theory(1)^2
    v = time * v1
    sqrt(v)
}


#' Compute summary statistics for a particular time
#'
#' @param ds data frame containing columns for winnings at a particular time
summary_at_time = function(ds)
{
    time = ds$time[1]
    w = ds$winnings
    data.frame(time, sample_mean = mean(w), sample_sd = sd(w))
}

ds = split(d, d$time)
dq = lapply(ds, summary_at_time)
dtheory = do.call(rbind, dq)


dtheory$pop_mean = mean_theory(dtheory$time)
dtheory$pop_sd = sd_theory(dtheory$time)



```
