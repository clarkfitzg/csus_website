Here is a tentative outline of topics for STAT 196K.
The goal of the course is to achieve the following learning outcomes.


## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

1. Develop complete statistical computer programs based on high level directions, using standard software packages. 
    Their programs will be complete in the sense that they start with processing raw data, and finish by producing final summaries and results necessary for reports.
3. Apply standard statistical techniques suitable for data larger than memory, for example, the split-apply-combine strategy for grouped data, memory efficient streaming statistics, discretization, and dimension reduction through principal components analysis.
4. Identify, extract, and summarize elements of interest from complex data sets, including tabular, hierarchical, streaming, image, and text data.
2. Summarize their approach and conclusions for a data analysis problem through technical written reports with appropriate graphics.
5. Perform data analysis using remote machines, which may include databases, remote compute clusters, and cloud services.
6. Accelerate and scale data analysis programs by identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks.


## Assignments

We'll have around 5 large assignments in the class, each focused on a different kind of data or problem.
Each assignment covers most of the above learning outcomes.
For example, we will run the programs for all the assignments on AWS, so all the assignments support the learning outcome "Perform data analysis using remote machines".

1. __Large Text Data__ is one or more text files larger than memory.
2. __Nested Data__ has a hierarchical, nested structure in one or many files, possibly la
