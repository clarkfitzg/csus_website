We will share our videos with each other through Canvas discussions.
This post describes several ways to upload videos and make them available to a Canvas discussion.

In this class, we use videos first of all to build community.
Don't spend hours making perfect videos; spend that time studying statistics.
üòé Recording videos with your smartphone is totally fine.
Recording your voice over a picture or slideshow is fine too.

You may feel self conscious and awkward if you watch your video or listen to a recording of your voice.
That's normal!
Stretch your comfort zone, post your recording, and know that everyone feels the same.
It does get easier.
If you're truly stuck, then contact me, and we'll come up with an alternative activity that you're more comfortable with.


## 1 - Record video directly in Canvas

If you have a webcam, you can use the recorder built in to canvas.
Click the record button and you'll see a screen like the one below.

IMPORTANT: after you click "save" it may appear that nothing happens.
It's actually uploading the video.
Don't navigate away, or you'll lose the recording.
I just keep the tab open and work on something else.
Even with a fast connection it can take a few minutes.

## 2 - Upload video directly in Canvas

Create a video file using the format, device, and recording software of your choice.
Smartphones work well if you don't have a webcam.
For example:

- you in front of a white board, classroom style
- you in front of a powerpoint, presentation style
- capture video while writing on tablet
- voice over slides
- voice over handwritten images

Click on the Canvas media upload ‚ñ∂Ô∏èüé∂ button, find the video file on your computer, and then upload it directly in the Canvas web interface.
