"How do I succeed in my college undergraduate classes?"
In short, through diligent study and discipline.

{% include personal_disclaimer.html %}

The tips that follow are from my [personal experience]( {% link _posts/2020-07-06-my-education-path.md %}) through undergrad; they're what worked for me.
You and I might be very different.
Pick and apply the ones you like, ignore the others. ðŸ¤˜

#### Only go to college when you're ready

Our society sets this expectation that to be successful, you must go straight to college out of high school.
This path is often wasteful, because you might squander the resources that allow you the time to go to school.
Instead, go live in a fun place and do things you like!
Work a seasonal job and travel.
When you travel, you'll meet young people from all over the world, and have a great time.
You have the whole rest of your life to be responsible.

When you're ready to go back to school, you can go to any community college.
On average, my community college teachers were better teachers than the Professors at UC Berkeley, who are famous for their research.
The older community college students in any math or science class are quite focused.
They know where they want to go, and that it's going to take work.


#### Work hard

You must put in the hours to learn.
Study hard, without distractions, at a time when your brain works best, and save easier tasks for when you're tired.
Cal Newport's [Study Hacks Blog](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/) has many further suggestions.


#### Challenge yourself

Take challenging classes.
Find out what you can do.
It's a fabulous feeling when a concept you've struggled with suddenly clicks inside your head.

Don't be afraid to do things where you might fail.
Indeed, we don't get enough ways to safely experience failure in college.


#### Maintain a can-do attitude

This can be extremely difficult when you're in a challenging situation.
You might think that you cannot do it, because the task is simply harder than you can handle.
Self-doubt begins to sabotage your effort.
It has happened to me.


#### Engage with others

Form study group with other students.
Teach others the material, and you will learn it better.
Professors love it when students engage with them and the material, because it allows them to see the material from a fresh viewpoint.


#### Don't worry about grades

It's easy to get caught up in grades.
Don't let a bunch of letters and numbers control your life.
If you put in your best effort by following the tips above, then the grades will follow.
