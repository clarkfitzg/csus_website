Here is a brief list of external resources for learning R.
<!--more-->     
Many other excellent resources are available besides what I list here, and I encourage you to search for and use them.

### Websites

1. [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html) originally by by Bill Venables and David M. Smith in 1990.
    It's been maintained and refined by R Core Developers since then.
2. [CRAN manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) by R Core Developers.
    These technical documents are the authoritative source of all things R.
    When people say, "read the manual", these are the manuals they're referring to.
1. [Stack Overflow R index page](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/r/info)
    Contains a large list of free resources for learning R.
    Stack Overflow is a popular Q & A site for programmers.
    If an answer has a large number of votes, then it's usually credible.
1. [fasteR](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) by Norm Matloff.
    Another introduction to R.
2. [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html) by Hadley Wickham.
    A deeper look into how R works.
    Quite readable.
2. [CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)
    Curated indexes of R software for specific applications, for example, [High Performance and Parallel Computing with R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html).
2. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham.
    Introduction to the tidyverse and Rstudio IDE.
3. [R language definition](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html) by R Core Developers.
    This is for the curious students who want to go deeper than my STAT 128 class and learn the precise semantics of the language.

### Books

1. [Data Science in R](https://www.routledge.com/Data-Science-in-R-A-Case-Studies-Approach-to-Computational-Reasoning-and/Nolan-Lang/p/book/9781482234817) by Deborah Nolan & Duncan Temple Lang.
    Deep, realistic case studies in data science.
    I recognize several of these chapters from assignments in Duncan's graduate level statistical programming class.
    [accompanying website](http://rdatasciencecases.org/)
2. [The Pragmatic Programmer] by David Thomas & Andrew Hunt.
    Classic text on general best practices for programming, not R specific.
