This is a warm up activity for the first day of classes.


### What's your word of the day?

Pick one (appropriate) word.
Maybe it's how you feel, for example, excited or nervous.
Maybe it's your outlook on the world based on the news.
Maybe it's your dreams about the future.
1-2-3-GO put it in the chat.


### Send a private chat message to someone in Zoom.

Introduce yourself.
Maybe it's someone with the same word as you, or a totally different word.
I cannot see private chat messages, and even if I could, I would never read them.
Every class period, we'll do brief warm up activities to get us talking and engaged.
This is your opportunity to meet and interact with others in the class.
You may not choose to engage much with others via chat, and this is absolutely fine.


### Share virtual interaction skills. üëç

Doing everything virtually takes new and different skills.
Let's learn from each other.
You're probably better than most of your professors.
Teach your professors! üòú

This is how I prefer my Zoom screen to look when I'm attending a meeting:

Presentation, several people, then chat window.
Play around with your Zoom settings, for example, I changed my default so it doesn't go full screen in presentation mode.


### 2020 has been crazy. üß® #AmIRight?

A side effect of this craziness is that I, along with many other faculty, have completely rethought how we teach.
My inexperience in teaching turns out to be a strength, because I wasn't tied to any particular way of doing things, and I'm ready to adopt new technology.


### The future of school and work will be radically different.

We have the ability to quickly access any fact known to mankind.
Old school lecturing is out.
I'm going to try new things, and they won't all work.


### Our goal is for you to learn.

First principle, we're starting with this in mind.


### What's the best thing to learn in college?

We'll cover some technical topics in this course, and you'll grow familiar with them.
But is it so important that you are comfortable with some fancy technique of integration?
In 10 years, is someone going to call you out and say, "What's the PMF for a binomial distribution?"


### Let's learn independent, critical thinking.

In my opinion, this is the most important thing.
Look at a problem, reason through it, and come up with a reasonable solution.


### You'll need to engage.

It's going to take dedicated effort on your part.
Don't sit back and absorb; ask questions, engage.


### I'm your guide.

You can read the book, you can watch lectures online.
I need to offer more value.


### We're going to have lots of interaction


### Community agreement activity

breakout rooms.
