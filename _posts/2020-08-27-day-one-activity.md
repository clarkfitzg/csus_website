This is a warm up activity for the first day of classes.


### What's your word of the day? (1,2,3,GO)

Pick one (appropriate) word.
Maybe it's how you feel, for example, excited or nervous.
Maybe it's your outlook on the world based on the news.
Maybe it's your dreams about the future.
1-2-3-GO put it in the chat.


### Send a private chat message to someone in Zoom.

Introduce yourself.
Maybe it's someone with the same word as you, or a totally different word.
I cannot see private chat messages, and even if I could, I would never read them.
Every class period, we'll do brief warm up activities to get us talking and engaged.
This is your opportunity to meet and interact with others in the class.
You may not choose to engage much with others via chat, and this is absolutely fine.


### Share virtual interaction skills. üëç

Doing everything virtually takes new and different skills.
Let's learn from each other.
You're probably better than most of your professors.
Teach your professors! üòú

This is how I prefer my Zoom screen to look when I'm attending a meeting:

Presentation, several people, then chat window.
I've been using Zoom for months, and I found out last week that I can make it look like this.
Play around with your Zoom settings, for example, I changed my default so it doesn't go full screen in presentation mode.


### 2020 has been crazy. üß® #AmIRight?

A side effect of this craziness is that I, along with many other faculty, have completely rethought how we teach.
My inexperience in teaching turns out to be a strength, because I wasn't tied to any particular way of doing things, and I'm ready to adopt new technology.


### The future of school and work will be radically different.

We have the ability to quickly access any fact known to mankind.
Old school lecturing is out.


### The Economist Interviews Janet Napolitano

August 27, 2020

Relevant quote to data science starts around minute 13:00.

### Let's prepare to succeed in this new world.

I'm going to try new things, and they won't all work.
If you're not into this, you've got 2 weeks to nail down your schedule, and it won't offend me in the least if you switch classes.


### Our goal is for you to learn to reason.

First principle, we're starting with this in mind.
Reasoning is an active process.


### What unique value does a college course offer? (1,2,3,GO)

You can read the book, which is more correct and thorough than I will ever be.
You can watch lectures online from the most exciting, dynamic, and intelligent speakers in the world.
How can your college courses compete?


### You'll need to engage and interact.

It's going to take dedicated effort on your part.
Don't sit back and absorb; ask questions, engage.

An example of interaction is the warm call activity.
Problem- not everyone is comfortable with this kind of interaction.


### I'm your guide.

I'll provide structure and facilitate interaction.
I'll show you how to solve the problems.
I'll help you understand the concepts.


### Community agreement activity
