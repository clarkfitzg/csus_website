I'm a first generation college student, and a veteran.

I grew up in a small rural town without many opportunities or much excitement.
By the end of high school I was tired of school.
I didn't expect to ever go to college, so I joined the Army.

A few years later, after I got out, Bob O'Rourke, a salty old Vietnam veteran, advised me to go to school.
The new Post 9/11 GI bill education benefits looked pretty sweet.
I made significantly more money going to school than I did in the Army, or than I could have made from working.
