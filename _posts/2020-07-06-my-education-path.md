I didn't follow the typical route into higher education.
I served in the military, returned to community college after a break of several years, transferred to a university, worked, returned later to graduate school, and had kids while in school.
Every step of the way I felt like I was going to fail.
I made it through because of a positive attitude, a disciplined approach to my studies, and using available resources.

I grew up in a small rural town in Northern California.
By the end of high school I was tired of school.
I didn't expect to ever go to college, so I joined the Army.

A few years later, after I got out, Bob O'Rourke, a salty old Vietnam veteran, advised me to go to school.
The new Post 9/11 GI bill education benefits looked pretty sweet.
I made significantly more money going to school than I did in the Army, or than I could have made from working.
