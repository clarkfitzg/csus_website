| "How can I learn R?"

The best way is to read and write R code.
Read and understand every aspect of the code you're working with.
Read other people's code on Github, or the R source code itself, if you're more ambitious.
Write lots and lots of code, and do small experiments to build your understanding.
Write or blog about what you learn, and keep a journal of discovery.

Below are some online references to guide you on your journey, with the more advanced material appearing at the end.


#### [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

R for Data Science (2e) was written by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.

This book will help you quickly get started doing useful things with tabular data, i.e. spreadsheets, csv files, data frames.
The book introduces and explains the popular [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages in R, which are a collection of packages for manipulating tabular data.
The package I use most frequently is [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), because it makes great plots with relatively little effort.
