## Exercise

#### Prerequisite: Activate your AWS educate account

19 out of 34 of you have already done this.
Find an email from `support@awseducate.com` with subject line "Your AWS Educate Application".
The body starts like this:

> Hi -
> 
> Your educator has invited you to join AWS Educate and access a "Classroom" for your course work.
> A "Classroom" is a hands-on learning environment for you to access AWS services and practice AWS.
> There are no costs or fees to access a Classroom.

If you cannot find it, then let me know, and I'll resend the invite.
Follow the steps and click through the email links to create and activate your account.

1. Login to your [AWS Educate account](https://www.awseducate.com/signin/SiteLogin)
2. Navigate to "My Classrooms" on the top bar, find our class, "Analyzing and Processing Big Data", and click "Go to classroom", which will bring you to Vocareum.
3. Click on the blue "AWS Console" button to navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1#)
3. Launch an EC2 instance.
4. Choose "Community AMIs" and search for "stat196k" to find one with a title like "CSUS stat196k v1.0".
    Select that one, since it will have all the software and settings necessary for our class.
5. Use the default instance type, "t2.micro", then click "Review and Launch".
