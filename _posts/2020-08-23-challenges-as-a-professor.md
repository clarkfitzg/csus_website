It's easy to get the impression that your professors have everything figured out.
We don't, especially in the age of COVID-19.

My biggest challenge at the moment is balancing time between family and work.
As a new professor, there are always more things I could be working on: more class materials to prepare, more grading, more research projects.
I have young kids at home, and they demand attention all the time.
I care deeply about my role in my family, and in the University, and it's hard to perform well in both roles simultaneously.
