- Explain reasons to use the shell
- Do basic operations on files and directories, such as listing, creating, deleting, moving, and copying


## Announcements

- Our class Discord is an extension of our classroom.
    It is an inclusive, welcoming place.

123 GO: Come up with one example of either good or bad online classroom behavior.
By bad, we mean anything that takes away from student's learning, or could make others feel unwelcome.
For example:

- Bad: Sending private messages to someone who's not interested.
- Good: Helping someone through a technical issue.

## Correspondence between shell and file explorer windows

The shell is also known as: terminal, command line, UNIX shell, command prompt, console.
It comes in several flavors: bash, zsh, ksh, tcsh, fish.

Here we can see a shell and an open file explorer both listing the contents of my `csus_website` directory.

## Motivation

Reasons to use the shell:

1. The shell can interact with remote machines.
    GUI's aren't always available; the shell is.
    For us, the shell will be the __only__ way to interact with our machines.
    By using it locally, we get relevant experience.
2. The shell is more efficient and precise than GUI's.
    For example, suppose you have 100 `.csv` files and 100 `.txt` files sitting in one directory, and you want to put the `.csv` files in one directory, and the `.txt` files in another.
    This is trivial with the shell.
3. We can easily automate commands in the shell by saving the commands in a file.
4. The shell is stable.
    For example, [`ls` has been listing directories since 1971](https://linuxgazette.net/issue48/fischer.html).
    Learn these tools, and they'll serve you for your whole career.
3. Many programs have only a shell interface, for example, `aws s3`.
4. The shell can compose programs with `|`, the pipe.
    This idea makes the shell a powerful tool for processing raw text data, and we'll practice this technique in this class.
5. The shell has much in common with other programs, particularly those with roots in UNIX.
    When you use them all, there is a synergistic effect in your efficiency.
    For example, what is the function to list objects in an environment in R?
    `ls()`, from the UNIX `ls`.
    There's also `rm`, `head`, `grep`, ... the list goes on :)
6. Easier to share a sequence of steps with others, for example, to install software.
7. The shell can be customized to your heart's content.

Reasons NOT to use the shell:

1. There's a learning curve.
2. Commands can be cryptic.


## Time Productivity Curve


## Summary

- The __working directory__ is the location of the shell in the file system, analagous to the directory you open in a GUI file explorer.
- Two ways to identify files and directories:
    - An __absolute path__ unambiguously identifies files and directories within the file system.
        Absolute paths start with `\`, the root of the directory tree.
    - A __relative path__ gives the location of files and directories relative to the working directory.
- `~` means home directory, so `cd ~` means changes the working directory to your home directory.
- `..` means the parent directory, so if my working directory is `/Users/fitzgerald/projects`, and then I run `cd ..`, then my working directory will be `/Users/fitzgerald`.
- `*` is a __wildcard__ that matches any character.
    It can be combined with most of the commands below to operate on many files simultaneousy.
    For example, `rm *.txt` removes all files that end in `.txt` within the working directory.
- Arguments appear following the commands preceded by `-` or `--`.
    For example, `ls -R` lists all directories recursively from the working directory.
    The `-R` is for recursive.

ðŸ§¨  below denotes a command that can delete your files.
Proceed with caution, because you CANNOT undo.

Command |   Mnemonic    |   Example
------- |   --------    |   -----------
`cat`   |   concatenate |   `$ cat README` prints out the contents of the file `README`
`cd`    |   change directory    |   `cd bicycles` sets the working directory to `bicycles`
`cp`  ðŸ§¨|   copy    |   `$ cp a.txt b.txt` copies `a.txt` to `b.txt`, and deletes the old `b.txt`.
`echo`  |   echo text    |   `$ echo hello` prints out `hello`. `$ echo hello >> README` appends the line `hello` to the file `README`.
`ls` |   list directory    |   `$ ls` lists the contents of the working directory.
`mkdir` |   make directory    |   `$ mkdir bicycles` creates a new directory called `bicycles` within the working directory
`mv` ðŸ§¨ |   move |   `$ mv a.txt b.txt` renames `a.txt` to `b.txt`, and deletes the old `b.txt`.
`pwd` |   print working directory    |   If `$ pwd` displays `/Users/fitzgerald/projects/csus_website`, then this is the absolute path to my working directory.
`rm` ðŸ§¨ |   remove |   `$ rm b.txt` deletes the file `b.txt`. 



## Exercise

Open up a shell and perform the following tasks.
Turn in the commands you used, together with output.

1. Create a new directory `stat196k_exercise1` in your home directory.
2. Change your working directory to `stat196k_exercise1`.
3. Check the absolute pathname of the current working directory.
4. Create two files `data1.csv` containing just a single `1`, and `data2.csv` containing just a single `2`.
5. Verify the contents of these two files.
5. Create a directory called `data`.
6. Move all the `.csv` files into the directory `data` using a single command.
    This same command should work for 2 files, or 2,000 files.
7. Verify the files are in the directory `data`, and not in `stat196k_exercise1`.
7. Copy the `.csv` files from `data` into `stat196k_exercise1`. 
7. Verify using a single command that you have two copies of each `.csv` file, one in `stat196k_exercise1` and one in `stat196k_exercise1/data`.
8. Remove the `stat196k_exercise1` directory, and everything in it.
