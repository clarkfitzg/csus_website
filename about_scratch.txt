<!--
![profile picture]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/profile.jpg)
![profile picture](/assets/images/profile.jpg)

This works, but is super ugly and unwieldy.
Do I have to do this with every relative link?

The Liquid links {% link /img/profile.jpg %} seem to make more sense, because they validate the link.
![profile picture]({% link img/profile.jpg %})
![profile picture]({{ 'img/profile.jpg' | relative_url }})
-->
