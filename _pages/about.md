I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics & Statistics](https://www.csus.edu/college/natural-sciences-mathematics/mathematics-statistics/) at CSU Sacramento, where I teach classes in statistics, computing, and data science.
Here's [the story of my education]({% link _posts/2020-07-06-my-education-path.md %}), which explains how I ended up here.


This is my personal website, which I use to make course material publicly available.
I hope you find it useful.
It does not reflect the opinions of my employer.
Use code at your own risk.


I built this website using Jekyll, and you can find the [website source code here](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/csus_website).
Feel free to use it as a template or a starting point if you want to build a website.
All of my RTP ([research, tenure, and promotion](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/rtp)) documents are also online.
The RTP repository contains lots of personal reflection as I learn how to teach.
