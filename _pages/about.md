I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics & Statistics](https://www.csus.edu/college/natural-sciences-mathematics/mathematics-statistics/) at CSU Sacramento, where I teach [classes in statistics](https://catalog.csus.edu/courses-a-z/stat/), computing, and data science.
I graduated from UC Davis in 2019, where I studied with [Professor Duncan Temple Lang](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~duncan/) and spent lots of time in the [Datalab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/).
My research interests include software development, data science, and scaling statistical applications to large data sets.

This is my personal website.
It does not reflect the opinions of my employer.
If you find the content on this site useful, feel free to link to it, or [send me an email](mailto:fitzgerald@csus.edu).
Most content I post here is somewhat incomplete and unpolished, and I expect it to continue to evolve for many years.

## Personal

If only life were always as fun as pictures make it look.

The following posts are more about my personal experience and opinions, and less about technical content.
Most of my RTP ([research, tenure, and promotion](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/rtp)) documents are also online.
The RTP repository contains lots of personal reflection as I learn how to teach.

## Website

I built this website using Jekyll, and you can find the [website source code here](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/csus_website).
Feel free to use it as a template or a starting point if you want to build a website.

I have no special talents or interest in formatting.
If you're my student and it would be better if this website looked a different way, then just let me know.
