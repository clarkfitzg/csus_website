If it would totally make your day if I follow or connect with you on one of these platforms, then send me an email, because I rarely check them!
If you're an alumni of one of my courses and you're using what you learned from the course, then I would be especially glad to hear your story so that I can share with current classes.
Forgive me if I don't engage much publicly; my time is limited, and it goes to my family and students first.
