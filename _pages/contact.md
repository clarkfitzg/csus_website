Here are some ways to connect or otherwise see what I'm up to.
If it would totally make your day if I follow or connect with you on one of these platforms, then send me a brief note and let me know. üòÅ
Otherwise, I don't engage much through these platforms, since my time goes to my family and students first.

- Twitter [@clarkfitzg](https://twitter.com/clarkfitzg)
    I use Twitter to share content publicly.
- Github [@clarkfitzg](https://github.com/clarkfitzg)
    All kinds of old code and projects are sitting around in here.
- LinkedIn [@clarkfitzg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarkfitzg/)
