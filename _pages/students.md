## Stephen Gibson

Skateboarders can easily recognize tricks performed by other skateboarders.
Our goal in this project is to teach the computer to recognize skateboarding tricks.
Given a video of a skateboard trick, can the computer classify the trick with high probability?
Stephen developed a dataset and a machine learning model that can distinguish between two of the most common skateboarding tricks, ollies and kickflips.

Here's Stephen doing a kickflip:
