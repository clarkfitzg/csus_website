If you're a student at CSUS and you are interested in doing a research project involving data science or software development in Julia, R, or Python, then come by my office (Shasta 156) or [send me an email](mailto:fitzgerald@csus.edu).
If you're a major or minor in the [College Natural Science & Mathematics](https://www.csus.edu/college/natural-sciences-mathematics/), then [summer funding opportunities](https://www.csus.edu/college/natural-sciences-mathematics/research/sure-award.html) may be available.

A list of current and former students follows.

Aleksey analyzed tweets around the 2020 US presidential election for his final project in STAT 128.
He tracked the general sentiment of tweets mentioning each candidate over time, and used this to predict some of the outcomes in battleground states.
This project demonstrates persuasive graphics, and clean R code.


### Stephen Gibson

- Summer 2020
- [Machine Learning Skateboard Tricks](https://github.com/LightningDrop/SkateboardML)

Skateboarders can easily recognize tricks performed by other skateboarders.
Given a video of a skateboard trick, can the computer classify the trick with high probability?
Stephen developed a dataset and a machine learning model that can distinguish between two of the most common skateboarding tricks, ollies and kickflips.

Here's Stephen doing a kickflip:
