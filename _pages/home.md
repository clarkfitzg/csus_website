## Programming Tutorials 

Here are some resources for learning programming and data science.
Most of them are joint work with [Nick Ulle](https://github.com/nick-ulle).

- Course material, including many YouTube lectures, from [STA141C - Big Data and High Performance Computing](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/sta141c-winter19) when I taught it in 2019 at UC Davis.
    We covered lots of parallel R, shell, and SLURM.
- 2 day [SQL Workshop](http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~clarkf/sql/) for business majors at UC Davis.
    Assumes little technical background.
- [Python 4 week course](https://github.com/nick-ulle/2015-python)
- 1.5 hour YouTube video, [Overview of Python for Data Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxcUKfZSbb4).
    Here is the [code repository](https://github.com/clarkfitzg/python_april_2017)
- [Julia debugging tutorial]({% link _posts/2020-07-02-julia-debugger-tutorial.md %})
